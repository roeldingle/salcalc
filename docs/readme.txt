Payroll computation [CONFIDENTIAL]

Note: 
1. Pagibig is fixed to 100/100.
100 employee/100 employer. 

Formula:
Taxable income       = Salary - [sss+philhealth+pagibig]
 Net income            = Taxable income - tax due

Sample computation:
If salary is 15,000 [S/ME]

Taxable income    =  15,000.00 -   787.50 = 14,212.50
Net income        =  14,212.50 - 1,550.83 = 12,661.67
Total deduction =       787.50 + 1,550.83 =   2,338.33

where:
sss         = 500.00
philhealth = 187.50
pagibig    = 100.00
------------------
                  787.50 [deduction 1]

and deduction 2, is based on tax table.
